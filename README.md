Derek's Anti-Framework Framework (couldn't think of anything for "Y")

*Disclaimer: I'd advice against using this library. Rather, just browse the code and grab concepts from it.  I haven't done any coding on this since 2009, there is no documentation, few examples, it was built with only my needs in mind, and there is certainly room some performance tweaking.*


After spending years working in various PHP frameworks (CodeIgniter, Kohana, Zend, etc...), I grew to dislike how they box you in to their way of doing things.  So, I decided to write my own, basic, no frills framework.

It certainly doesn't provide you with a whole lot of functionality out of the box.  All you get is:

- Routing
- Templating
- RESTful API
- A Twitter OAuth library for authentication

For a basic, low-traffic site, that's about all you need to get started. The rest you can, and should, code yourself.  Whenever I start a new site, I usually begin with this library, and build from there.
